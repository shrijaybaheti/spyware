1. Click Command: /click [button] (x, y)
Format: /click [button] (x, y)
Parameters:
button:
Options: "left" or "right".
Note: If the button name is misspelled or not recognized, it won't execute the click.
(x, y):
Coordinates on the screen.
Issue: If the coordinates are outside the screen bounds or formatted incorrectly, the command may fail.
Example: /click left (100, 200)

2. Drag Command: /drag (x1, y1) (x2, y2)
Format: /drag (x1, y1) (x2, y2)
Parameters:
(x1, y1): Starting coordinates.
(x2, y2): Ending coordinates.
Issues: Similar to the click command, if the coordinates are incorrect or outside the screen bounds, dragging may not occur.
Example: /drag (100, 200) (300, 400)

3. Sleep Command: /sleep [seconds]
Format: /sleep [seconds]
Parameters:
seconds: Duration to pause execution (in seconds).
Issues: Non-numeric values or negative numbers will cause an error, potentially leading to command execution failure.
Example: /sleep 2

4. Scroll Command: /scroll [direction] [amount]
Format: /scroll [direction] [amount]
Parameters:
direction:
Options: "up" or "down".
Note: Misspelling or incorrect direction will cause the command to fail.
amount: Number of scroll units (positive for "up", negative for "down").
Issues: Non-integer values or excessively large amounts might not produce the intended scrolling effect.
Example: /scroll up 3

5. Type Command: /type "[text]"
Format: /type "[text]"
Parameters:
text: The text to be typed, enclosed in double quotes.
Issues: Special characters may not be typed correctly depending on the keyboard layout, or the program may not handle certain non-ASCII characters well.
Example: /type "Hello World"

6. Hold Key Command: /hold [key]
Format: /hold [key]
Parameters:
key: The key to hold down.
Common Keys: shift, ctrl, alt, capslock, tab, enter, etc.
Issues:
Keys like F1 to F12, PrtSc, Insert, Delete, etc., may not be recognized if not explicitly handled in the script.
Misnaming the key will cause failure (e.g., /hold cntrl instead of /hold ctrl).
Example: /hold shift

7. Lift Key Command: /lift [key]
Format: /lift [key]
Parameters:
key: The key to release.
Issues: Similar to the hold command; if the key wasn't previously held or is misspelled, the command won't function as expected.
Example: /lift shift

8. Shortcut Command: /shortcut "[keys]"
Format: /shortcut "[keys]"
Parameters:
keys: A combination of keys separated by + (e.g., ctrl+alt+del).
Issues: If any key is misspelled, or if the combination includes unsupported keys, the command may fail. Not all combinations will work as intended in every application.
Example: /shortcut "ctrl+alt+del"

9. Tap Command: /tap [key]
Format: /tap [key]
Parameters:
key: A single key to press and release.
Common Keys: enter, space, esc, etc.
Issues: If the key is not recognized (like some multimedia keys), the command may fail. Non-standard keys may require additional handling.
Example: /tap enter
